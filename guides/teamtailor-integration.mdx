\*\*Set up your automation trigger: \*\*Go to your listed jobs on Teamtailor, then click "Triggers" \> "Request HirePass pre-employment check" to add the automated request at your chosen hiring stage. Most people choose "Offered" as it's the natural point where checks become essential.

**Configure your check settings:**  Select the check package you'd like to use for this role. You can also choose to automatically move candidates to the next stage once their checks are 100% complete. When you click "Add trigger", the HirePass logo will appear on your hiring stage as confirmation.

**Watch the magic happen:** Once your chosen candidate reaches the hiring stage with the trigger, HirePass automatically sends them a personalised email with clear instructions to start their pre-employment checks. When completed, their comprehensive report uploads directly to their Teamtailor profile for your review.
