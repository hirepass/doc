description: "The DBS lets UK employers know if someone has a criminal record or if they’re on a list of people who aren’t allowed to work with children or vulnerable adults."

## Understanding the different DBS levels:

### 1. DBS Basic:

- Contains details of any unspent criminal convictions or conditional cautions the applicant has.
- Applicable to all job roles — most applicants should use this level.

### 2. DBS Standard:

- Includes details of both spent and unspent criminal convictions, cautions, reprimands, and warnings from the Police National Computer (PNC).
- Suitable for positions of responsibility such as accountancy or legal professionals.

### 3. DBS Enhanced:

- Contains the same information as the Standard DBS check, plus any additional information held by local police that is considered relevant to the role being applied for.
- Essential for roles that involve working with vulnerable groups, including children, such as teaching and healthcare roles.
