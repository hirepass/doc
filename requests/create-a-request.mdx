title: "Create a request"

### Sending your first request:

When a request is created, our system automatically sends an email to the applicant, asking for their consent and any necessary information to begin the compliance checks.

Each onboarding form is uniquely encrypted and tailored to the applicant, adapting dynamically to gather only the most relevant information based on the applicant's responses. Our intelligent form adapts in real-time, validating data on the spot to ensure accuracy and speed. By reducing errors and unnecessary questions, your compliance process becomes not only faster but also more secure and user-friendly.

#### Primary Input fields:

1. **checkPackageUuid**(required): Specifies the check package to be used for the request.
2. **applicantComment** (optional): Provides guidance and supporting comments to the Applicant.
3. **firstName** (required) / **middleName** (optional) / **surname** (required): The applicant's name, separated into three main components.
4. **email** (required): The applicant's contact email, where the request notification will be sent.
