title: "Create a new webhook"
description: "When important changes happen, like new requests or status updates, HirePass® sends notifications to a web address you choose. This means you don't need to keep checking the system manually."

### Obtaining your HirePass® webhooks key:

1. Log in to your [HirePass®](https://workspace.hirepass.com) account.
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** section.
3. Select **Webhooks** from the menu.
4. Create a New webhook key:
   - **Events: **Select the events that the webhook will start listening to. These events act as triggers to send requests to the webhook.
   - **Label**: Enter a label for your webhook. This can be anything that helps you identify the webhook's purpose, such as “Status updates” or “Package notifications.”
   - **URL**: Enter the URL of the endpoint where you want to receive the webhook requests. Make sure the URL is correctly formatted and accessible.
   - **Token:** The authentication key is an optional field that can be generated on the webhook origin side. It will then be sent within the request as an Authorization Bearer Token.
   - Click **Create new webhook**.

### Using the webhook key:

The webhook key will be included in the `Authorization` header of each request sent to your endpoint. You will need to implement validation logic on your server to verify the authenticity of each incoming request using this key.

### Testing the webhook connection:

After completing the setup, test your webhook endpoint. This will ensure you're properly receiving the data from HirePass®. To test the webhook connection, click on "Test connection", and a placeholder test will be sent to your URL.

- **Disconnected**: Acess to this webhook has been revoked.

### Security reminder.

- **Use HTTPS**: Make sure your webhook URL uses HTTPS to keep data secure during transmission.
- **Keep you key secure**: Do not share this key publicly or expose it in your code repositories.
- **Rotate keys regularly**: Regularly rotate your key to enhance security and update your validation logic accordingly.
