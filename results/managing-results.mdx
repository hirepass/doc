title: "Managing results"

Our GraphQL API is designed to keep you closely connected with the status of your compliance requests, providing real-time updates that ensure you stay informed at every step. Whether the results come back clear, are still in progress, or require your attention due to being flagged for review, you can easily access detailed insights that will guide your decision-making process.

### **Results are available in two formats:**

We make it easy for you to access results in two convenient formats:

- by check package
- by individual element

By offering both formats, we aim to provide you with the insights you need to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. You can easily compare results, identify trends, and address any issues that may arise, all while ensuring that your compliance process remains smooth and organised.

### Understanding statuses:

We provide a comprehensive set of status indicators that reflect the current state of each request:

- **Requested**: An email has been sent to the applicant to gather their consent and the necessary information required to initiate the compliance checks. This status indicates that the onboarding process is underway, pending a response from the applicant to move forward.
- **In progress**: The compliance check is currently being conducted. You can expect ongoing updates as the system processes the request and gathers the necessary information.
- **Completed**: The compliance check has been successfully completed, and results are ready for review. You can access detailed insights and findings related to this check.
- **Completed with alert**: The compliance check has been completed; however, there are notable findings or discrepancies that require your attention. This status will highlight areas that may need further investigation.
- **Canceled**: The compliance check has been canceled, either by the HR team or due to a change in requirements. This status indicates that no further action will be taken on this request.
- **Unable to verify**: The system was unable to complete the verification process due to missing information or issues with the data provided. This status alerts you to potential gaps that need to be addressed to proceed.
