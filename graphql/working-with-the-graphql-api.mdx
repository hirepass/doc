### **What is GraphQL?**

GraphQL is a flexible query language for APIs, giving you precise control over what data you retrieve from a server. Unlike traditional REST APIs where you hit different endpoints for different data, GraphQL lets you fetch exactly what you want in one request. Nothing more, nothing less.

### **Why use GraphQL**:

- **Efficiency**: Ask for only the data you need.
- **Flexibility**: Fetch multiple related resources in a single request.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple, intuitive queries that return predictable results.

If you’re new to GraphQL, we recommend checking out this great beginner-friendly resource:

- [The Official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org)

Now, let’s get into how to use it with HirePass\!

### **How GraphQL queries work** (a quick primer):

Once your account has been [authenticated](/graphql/api-authentication-key), it’s time to build your first GraphQL query\!

Here’s how a basic query is structured:

#### **Basic GraphQL query structure**:

1. **Starting with a query or mutation keyword**: Queries fetch data; mutations modify it.
2. **Specifying the fields you want**: You choose which fields to return, cutting down on unnecessary data.
3. **Sending a request**: The API will return just the data you asked for.

**Example**

```
//
```

In this example:

- We're asking for all check requests from your organisation.
- We're requesting specific fields: `uuid`, `externalId`, `progressStatus`, and the associated applicant's `completeName`.

## **Try it yourself.**
